# Counter-Strike-Global-Offensive-Callout-Quiz
Quiz based on the 2013 videogame Counter-Strike: Global Offensive made by Valve.
 The videogame is a competitive first-person shooter which has different maps, all of which have strategical spots players can be positioned in.
 Callouts are used to define these spots and to *call out* an enemy's position so that the team can attack and defeat that player.
 In the quiz, a spot will be described, and the user must enter the name of the callout in lowercase.
 
 The project is written in Python 3, and is made for players of the game to practice their knowledge about the different callouts. In the future, It will be an actual program with an UI, for now, I am writing the code of the application. Feel free to send me any criticism or ways to improve/optimize the code.
 This is my first ever project, I am very young and new to programming, and I hope this goes well! 
 
 Thanks for reading.
